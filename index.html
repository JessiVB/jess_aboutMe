    <p class="tagline2">I am a tech recruiter transitioning into engineering</p>
    <p>
        I'm in an incredibly fortunate position being able to experience two career paths that intertwine with each other. As a recruiter, we were always seen as social sales-people. Engineers didn't trust us because they thought we just saw them as commission. They didn't respect us because they felt we didn't understand the complexities of the roles we are hiring them for. Often times, we felt engineers carried themselves with an atmosphere of superiority which we, as recruiters have fed into because we hound them relentlessly. Engineers are seen as introverted, awkward, elitist loners. Recruiting, one would think, is all about networking, perfecting our images of being extroverted social butterflies.<br>
        
        <br>This journey, however, has taught me that this was quite the opposite. As a recruiter, I never went to 'recruiter' meetups or sat there consistently comparing the newest, coolest way to source people. Mostly, we'd just post in Slack and go on about our day.<br>

        <br>Engineering has been filled with so much acceptance and I'm not even an engineer yet! I have mentors, advisors, invitations to meet ups, and some of my closest and most supportive friends are engineers. It's hard work, but I feel incredibly lucky to be in this position. This journey has certainly humbled me and made me so appreciative for recruiting because it's gotten me to this point.
